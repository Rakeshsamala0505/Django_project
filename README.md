# Django Project: User Authentication System

## Project Description

Welcome to the User Authentication System project! This project is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. The primary objective of this project is to provide a robust and secure user authentication system, ensuring that users can register, log in, and manage their profiles efficiently.

**Note:** This project is intended to run on a local server only and is not configured for deployment in a production environment.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Allows new users to create an account using their email and a secure password.
- **User Login**: Enables existing users to log in with their credentials.
- **Secure Authentication**: Implements industry-standard security practices to protect user data.
- **Responsive Design**: The frontend is designed using HTML and CSS, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: Backend framework for building the web application.
- **Python**: Programming language used for backend logic.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web pages.
- **SQLite**: Default database for development purposes.
- **JavaScript**: For enhancing user experience on the frontend.

## Installation Instructions

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

3. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv env
    ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment**:
    - On Windows:
        ```sh
        .\env\Scripts\activate

    ```

7. **Create a superuser** (optional but recommended for accessing the admin site):
    ```sh
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

8. **Run the development server**:
    ```sh
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

9. **Open your browser and visit**:
    ```sh
